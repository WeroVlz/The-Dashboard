## Running a Streamlit Application

Streamlit is an amazing tool that lets you easily convert your Python scripts into interactive web applications without requiring any web development knowledge.

### Running the Application::

Once you have streamlit installed and are in the directory containing app.py, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

After running the command, Streamlit will show you a URL in your terminal. Typically, it's something like http://localhost:8501/. Open that URL in your browser to view and interact with your application.

### Additional Options:

If you want to learn more about the options that streamlit run offers, you can use:

```bash
streamlit run --help
```
